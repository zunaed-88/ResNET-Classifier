# ResNet Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a classifier using the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) architecture. The ResNet model is a deep neural network known for its ability to efficiently train very deep networks. In this project, the ResNet classifier is designed to perform image classification on a specific dataset.

## Features

- **Residual Blocks:** The classifier utilizes residual blocks, allowing the training of deeper networks without encountering the vanishing gradient problem.

- **Deep Learning:** Implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

- **Transfer Learning:** The ResNet architecture supports transfer learning, making it suitable for various image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The classifier is trained and tested on a labeled dataset of images. The dataset used for this project is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the ResNet architecture.

## Model Architecture

The classifier is built on the ResNet architecture, which includes residual blocks with skip connections. The architecture is chosen for its ability to efficiently train deep neural networks.

## Training

The model is trained on the specified dataset using appropriate training parameters. The training process involves optimizing the model's weights and biases to achieve high accuracy in image classification.

## Usage

To use the ResNet classifier, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Load the pre-trained ResNet model using the provided script.
3. Input an image for classification.

```bash
python classify_resnet.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
